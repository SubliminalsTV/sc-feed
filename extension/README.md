# SC Feed Companion (browser extension)

Owner tool. **Chrome is the maintained target** — see "Firefox build (frozen)" below. Three jobs:

1. **RSI token sync** — reads the HttpOnly `Rsi-Token` cookie from robertsspaceindustries.com
   (where Sub is logged in as the Evocati account) and pushes it to SC Feed's owner endpoint,
   so the cron's `RSI_TOKEN` refreshes itself instead of the manual DevTools copy-paste.
   It only ever stores Sub's token — the endpoint is owner-gated and writes one locked row.
2. **MOTD scrape** — RSI made `getMotd` moderator-only, so the MOTD can only be read from a
   rendered lobby page. Two paths:
   - *passive* — `content.js` catches changes instantly while you're browsing Spectrum;
   - *active* — every 15 min the background worker ensures a **pinned background tab** for each
     testing-chat lobby (`38230` → `motd-sc`, `1355241` → `motd-evo`), reviving it if Chrome's
     Memory Saver discarded it, and injects the extractor via `chrome.scripting`.

   Every scrape POSTs to `/api/owner/motd` **even when the text is unchanged**. The server
   compares signatures: a change writes a new MOTD card, an unchanged scrape only stamps the
   `motd_scan_<channel>` heartbeat. That heartbeat is what the watchdog watches — it is the only
   thing that tells "scraper alive, MOTD just quiet" apart from "scraper dead".
3. **Feed awareness** — polls `/api/sc-feed` every 5 min, shows the unread count on the toolbar
   badge, and fires a desktop notification when new items land (even with SC Feed closed). The
   popup shows the latest items, an **Open SC Feed** button, and a **Capture window** button
   (clean 1280×720 popup for stream window-capture).

> ⚠️ **Keep RSI signed in on ONE browser only.** RSI allows a single session per account, so a
> second signed-in browser silently invalidates the token this extension just pushed — which
> reads exactly like "the extension keeps resetting my token / logging me out."

## Files
- `manifest.json` — Chrome / Edge (MV3, `background.service_worker`) — **the live one**
- `manifest.firefox.json` — Firefox / Zen (MV3, `background.scripts` + gecko id) — frozen
- `background.js`, `content.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.js` — shared
- `build-firefox.sh` — assembles `dist-firefox/` (Firefox manifest as `manifest.json`) for signing

## Configure (popup → Settings)
- **SC Feed URL** — default `https://sc-feed.subliminal.gg`
- **Token push endpoint** — default `…/api/owner/rsi-token`
- **Push secret** — `OWNER_PUSH_SECRET` (from Bitwarden: `bw-lookup --raw "API - SCFeed Owner Push Secret"`)
- **Desktop notifications** — on/off

## Install — Chrome / Edge
`chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → **Load unpacked** → select this folder. No build step —
`manifest.json` is already the Chrome manifest. After an edit, hit **Reload** on the card.

## Firefox build (frozen)
`manifest.firefox.json` is pinned at **0.2.5** and is no longer kept in sync — it predates the
`scripting` permission and the active MOTD scan, so a build from it will run the passive scrape
only. The files stay for revival; to bring it back, mirror the Chrome manifest's `version` and
`permissions`, then follow the signing steps below.

Firefox/Zen require a signed add-on for permanent install. Sign it **unlisted** on AMO (free):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SubliminalsTV-Projects/sc-feed.git
cd sc-feed/extension
./build-firefox.sh                      # → dist-firefox/
npm install -g web-ext                  # one-time
# Get API creds at https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addon/api/key/
web-ext sign --source-dir=dist-firefox --channel=unlisted \
  --api-key=<ISSUER> --api-secret=<SECRET>
```

`web-ext sign` outputs a signed `.xpi` under `web-ext-artifacts/`. In Zen: `about:addons` →
gear icon → **Install Add-on From File…** → pick the `.xpi`. Permanent, survives restarts.

(Quick test without signing: `about:debugging` → This Firefox → **Load Temporary Add-on** →
pick `dist-firefox/manifest.json`. Resets on restart.)

## Verify
- Popup → **Push token now** → status reads `✓ token synced`. The owner backend at `/owner`
  shows `{ set: true, updated_via: "extension" }`.
- Popup → **Scan MOTD now** → takes up to ~40s (it waits for the SPA to render), then the popup
  shows a line per lobby, e.g. `MOTD scan 0m ago — sc ✓ · evo ✓ new`. On `/owner`, the two MOTD
  rows go green and their age column now reads **time since last scrape**, not since last change
  (hover for both clocks).
- New feed items raise the toolbar badge + a notification.
